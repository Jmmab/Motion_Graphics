# What I've Learned
- Panels:
    - Project Panel;
    - Composition Panel;
    - Timeline/Layers Panel.
    <!-- you have a lot of flexibility with panels and Workspace control -->
- How to import files;
- What is a Composition;
- Layers and file size are very important;
- Why Resolution is important;
    <!-- After Effects is a raster-based program -->
- Frame Rate and Timecode;
    <!-- the standard for animation is 24 -->
- How to use the **'Parent and Link'** feature to apply ***relative transformations***;
    <!-- basically, the "children" will inherit the transformations of the parent layer -->
    <!-- - 'Transform' > 'Fit to Comp ...' -->
- Precomps: Why organization is so important in an animation project;
    - Precomps are very important!!
    <!-- !!! right click > Replace Footage > With Layered Comp -->
- Transformations!!!
    - Position (P);
    - Scale;
    - Rotation;
    - Opacity;
    - Anchor Point.
        <!-- very useful: use 'Alt' + correspondent key to add property keyframe -->
        <!-- affects the other properties! -->
        <!-- Anchor Point Tool -->
    <!-- Take note: you can also copy and paste transformation properties -->
- Snapping feature;
- You can Lock layers!
- Keyframes! Keyframes are "values at a given time". They are very essential to any animation software; </br>
    Linear Keyframes:
    - 'Motion Path' for visualization;
    - 'Work Area' for "looping" what you see;
    - Just like with properties, you can copy keyframes;
    - **Attention!** Pasting keyframes is based on current time;
    - You can control the timing of the keyframes along the time of the composition;
    - By default, keyframes will ***interpolate***;
    - Beware: _Continuous Bezier_.
- ***Timing*** and ***Spacing***;
    <!-- very important concepts!! -->
    <!-- timing can't be changed, but spacing can, that's related to the level of "smoothness" of the animation -->
    - . : Right click > 'Keyframe Assistant' > 'Easy Ease'
- As subtle as it is, **Easing** it's usually one of those things that make a lot of difference in the end-result of an animation;
- **'Solo Layer'** feature;
- 'Layer' > 'Pre-compose';
- 'Toogle Hold Keyframe';
