# What I've Learned
- Panels:
    - Project Panel;
    - Composition Panel;
    - Timeline/Layers Panel.
    <!-- you have a lot of flexibility with panels and Workspace control -->
- How to import files;
    - Layered Illustrator files (e.g. : the "animated" heads) can be replaced later by going: right click > Replace Footage > With Layered Comp.
<!-- - H.264 Format -->
- What is a Composition;
- Layers and file size are very important;
- Why Resolution is important;
    <!-- After Effects is a raster-based program -->
- Frame Rate and Timecode;
    <!-- the standard for animation is 24 -->
- How to use the **'Parent and Link'** feature to apply ***relative transformations***;
    <!-- basically, the "children" will inherit the transformations of the parent layer -->
    <!-- - 'Transform' > 'Fit to Comp ...' -->
- Precomps: Why organization is so important in an animation project;
    - Precomps are very important!!
- Transformations!!!
    - Position (P);
    - Scale;
    - Rotation;
    - Opacity;
    - Anchor Point.
        <!-- very useful: use 'Alt' + correspondent key to add property keyframe -->
        <!-- affects the other properties! -->
        <!-- Anchor Point Tool -->
    <!-- Take note: you can also copy and paste transformation properties -->
- Snapping feature;
- You can Lock layers!
- Keyframes! Keyframes are "values at a given time". They are very essential to any animation software; </br>
    Linear Keyframes:
    - 'Motion Path' for visualization;
    - 'Work Area' for "looping" what you see;
    - Just like with properties, you can copy keyframes;
    - **Attention!** Pasting keyframes is based on current time;
    - You can control the timing of the keyframes along the time of the composition;
    - By default, keyframes will ***interpolate***;
    - Beware: _Continuous Bezier_.
- ***Timing*** and ***Spacing***;
    <!-- very important concepts!! -->
    <!-- timing can't be changed, but spacing can, that's related to the level of "smoothness" of the animation -->
    - . : Right click > 'Keyframe Assistant' > 'Easy Ease'
- As subtle as it is, **Easing** it's usually one of those things that make a lot of difference in the end-result of an animation;
- **'Solo Layer'** feature;
- 'Layer' > 'Pre-compose';
    - Why ??? </br>
    The cool thing about Pre-comps is that they allow you to make more complex animations, even with some very basic elements. It also makes it more easy to break the animation down into smaller parts to make adjustments later
    <!-- you can either pass the *attributes on to the created precomp or not - that could be a relevant choice depending on what you're trying to do -->
    <!-- another important thing about Pre-comps is that when creating them, you can select the option 'Adjust composition duration to time span...', which might be useful -->
- 'Toogle Hold Keyframe';
- (...)
- How to export videos using AME (Adobe Media Encoder);
- How to apply Effects;
    - There are many types of effects: Generative, Manipulative, etc;
    - How to use **Adjustment Layers** to quickly apply affects on multiple elements (layers);
    - The order in which you apply the effects makes a lot of difference in the end result!
- Masking;
    <!-- 'Masks' and 'Shape Layers' (?) are vectors inside of AE -->
    <!-- you can make a lot of interactions between Masks as well -->
- Working with Text
    <!-- it's worth noting that the anchor point on text layers works a little bit differently -->
    - You can animate text by using some awesome animation presets!
    <!-- the text remains editable! -->
- What is a Null Layer;
- How to invert Keyframes;
- How to add final effects to achieve a professional look;
    - How to use masks along with effects to obtain some interesting results.
- How to create and export a Loop in After Effects.
    - Using After Effetcs natively `vs` Using AME.
